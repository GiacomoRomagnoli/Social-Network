# Conclusions

## Future Works
The project will be updated and maintained over time following the schema outlined in the 
[Incremental Development](../implementation/incremental-development.md) section.

Planned future enhancements include:

- Authentication
- Administrator users and related functionalities
- User interface
- Strengthening the architecture with an API Gateway
- Metrics

## Acknowledgement
During the development of the project, we had the opportunity to experiment with DevOps principles, 
aiming to automate all processes that we had previously carried out manually to varying degrees.

We gained a general understanding of system deployment activities and delved deeper into Docker as a technology. 
Finally, we explored microservices architecture, which today represents a well-established industry standard.

## Considerations

The modern approach used in the development of this project allowed us to draw personal conclusions about the method itself. 
It is undeniable that a significant overhead must be paid to introduce automation and best practices, especially when lacking experience.
However, the final results justify the effort, which transforms into the certainty that each process will succeed.
