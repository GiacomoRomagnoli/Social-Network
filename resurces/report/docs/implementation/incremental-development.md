# Incremental Development
The project is designed to be maintained and extended, which is why, during the analysis and design phase, 
we gathered and analyzed a set of requirements that represent the project's final objective. 
Subsequently, during the design and implementation phase, 
we considered how to break down intermediate objectives over time, 
each linked to a version of the software and a release.

- **v1.0.0**  
  Implementation of microservices and essential functionalities.


- **v2.0.0**  
  Upgrade of the architecture with an API gateway, metrics, and key functionalities.


- **v3.0.0**  
  Implementation of a user interface.
