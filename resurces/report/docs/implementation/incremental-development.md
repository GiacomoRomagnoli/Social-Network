# Incremental Development
The project is designed to be maintained and extended, which is why, during the analysis and design phase, 
we gathered and analyzed a set of requirements that represent the project's final objective. 
Subsequently, during the design and implementation phase, 
we considered how to break down intermediate objectives over time, 
each linked to a version of the software and a release.

- **v1.0.0**  
  Implementation of microservices and essential functionalities.


- **v2.0.0**  
  Upgrade of the architecture with an API gateway, metrics, and key functionalities.


- **v3.0.0**  
  Implementation of a user interface.


Thanks to the use of practices such as semantic versioning and semantic release, 
software updates will be clear and distinguishable. 
Further technical details on the topic are available in section
[Continues Integration](../devops/ci.md).
