# Event Storming
Our knowledge-crunching sessions have continued using the Event Storming approach, 
leveraging a collaborative board and post-it notes to identify the system's main components and interactions. 
The process is iterative, and all steps are detailed in the following sections.

The sessions were conducted using the Miro platform.

# Unstructured Exploration
During the first iteration, each team member write possible domain events that could happen in the system, 
at put it on the board, without any specific order.

# Timeline
Domain events are now organized in the order in which they occur in the business domain.

# Pain Points
The team tries to identify pain points in the system, spotting possible process that require attention.

# Pivotal Points
The team identifies pivotal points in the system, where the system could be split in different bounded contexts.

# Commands
The team now identifies and describes the command that trigger the event or flow of events, 
describing the systemâ€™s operations. 
In addition, has been specified also the actor whose trigger the command.

# Policies
The team identifies the policies, commands without an actor, that are executed within the system.

# Aggregates
Now, once all the events and commands are represented, they are grouped into aggregates.

# Bounded Contexts
Finally, the team identifies the bounded contexts, the boundaries of the system, 
where each bounded context is a separate domain model.

The identified bounded contexts are:

`Friendships`: everything related to the friendships between users and their messages.\
`Users`: everything related to the users, authentication and access to app features.\
`Contents`: everything related to posts.
